-  bresenham:
   
   Input: Two vectors that contain the pair of coordinates (x,y) for the starting point and the end point.
   
   Function: It creates a line starting at one point and finishing on another anywhere on the XY plane using Bresenham's algorithm
   
-  circles:

   Input: Real numbers x,y,r for the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius respectively.
   
   Function: It creates a circle of center (x,y) and radius r

-  ellipsis:

   Input: Real numbers x,y,a,b for the coordinates of the center and the length of the major and minor axis respectively
   
   Function: It creats an ellipse of center (x,y) and axis length a and b (described by the equation x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2)
